A simple web-based basketball scoreboard that lets you keep track of scores for two teams: **Home** and **Guest**. You can increment each team's score by 1, 2, or 3 points and reset the game at any time.

## Features

- Add 1, 2, or 3 points to either team
- "New Game" button resets both scores to zero
- Clean, retro-inspired design with a custom digital font
